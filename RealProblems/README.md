# Why not algorithm in Swift
I am an iOS software engineer and I love using Swift rather than C++, Java or Python to solve algorithm problem even though I am not good enough.  

During applying many companies, I realized that knowing algorithm is inevitable but not many articles or solutions are wriiten in Swift code. I know the type of language is not a crucial factor to understand algorithmatic thoght. However, whenever I see the solution which compressed to one or two lines using standard libraries, especially C++, It makes me frustrated.  

Alright then, why not Swift?  

This github repositoy is for the all questions I gave during technical interview and solutions in Swift.  
Hope those who love Swift like it. :)
