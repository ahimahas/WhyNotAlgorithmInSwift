Let's assume that we have 4 different peace of Lego which height are 1, 3, 4 or 6 for each.

With given Int number whcih represent total heights, find out how many ways to assemble Lego peaces to reach that height.

- Input: height <Int>  
- Output: number of ways <Int>  

Ex. when given height is 4, the output number will be 3 such as;  
 - 1, 1, 1, 1

## Behind Story
It was the tech interview question by G. At the time, I couldn't get a clue how to solve this issue but I found the solution from the book named, "Cracking the Coding Interview" later on.
